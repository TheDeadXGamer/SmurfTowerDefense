# SmurfTowerDefense
Project for the course Objektorienterat Programmeringsprojekt (TDA367) at Chalmers.

## Description of the project
We wanted to make a game where you can pass the time without having to do too much.
That's why we decided to make a Tower Defense game. And as an added twist we decided to theme it around the smurf universe. That is to say that the smurfs are the towers and the enemies are gargamel.

This project was designed iteratively using feedback from users.

## How to install

Requirements:
- Maven
- Java 21 or later

1. Clone the repository to your desired directory
2. Open CMD or any preferable equivalent of it
3. Change the directory to `"yourpath/smurftowerdefense"`
4. Run the command ` mvn clean install `. If Maven is correctly installed it should add the dependencies of the project correctly.
5. Either run the ` Main.java ` file or run the command ` java -jar target/smurftowerdefense-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar `
